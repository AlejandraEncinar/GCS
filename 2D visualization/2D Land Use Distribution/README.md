# Land Uses Distribution 2D Visualization

This project provides a 2D visualization of the distribution of land uses. It demonstrates the concept of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), where particles representing land uses are attracted towards designated interest points (parks). The code can be executed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

The results generated by the code will be stored in the "plots" folder. There are three versions available:

1. All land uses organizing around 1 park.
2. All land uses organizing around 3 parks in 3 different nodes.
3. All land uses organizing around 3 parks in 3 different nodes.

The generated JPG files can later be transformed into a GIF using appropriate tools or libraries.

## Visualization

The visualization shows the movement of the land uses (represented as bubbles) towards the designated parks. Each iteration of the optimization process is saved as a JPG image. By combining these images, a GIF can be generated to demonstrate the progression of the land uses distribution.

Please note that the algorithm used in this project is a simplified representation of PSO and is intended for visualization purposes rather than optimization tasks.

## Acknowledgements

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing.
- numpy for array manipulation.
- matplotlib for plotting and visualization.

Enjoy exploring and visualizing the distribution of land uses in this 2D representation!
